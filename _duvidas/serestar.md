Temporary and permanent characteristics 


# Ser
What you are essentially, your identity

> *Sou homem, sou inglÃªs*

# Estar

## Accidental properties in general

> *Estou enfastiado*

## Location in particular 

> *Estou no supermercado*


# Notes

- Ser can only take one preposition - de. 

> *Sou de Inglaterra*

So the confusion between ser and ir in the perfect form, which is identical, can usually be solved by looking for the preposition:

> *fui no supermercado*

Can only be *ir*
